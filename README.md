### Hi there, I'm [Daochen Zha (查道琛 in Chinese)!](https://dczha.com/) 👋👋👋

🌱 I’m currently a PhD student in CS@Rice

🔭 I’m currently working on machine learning and data mining, particularly on Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)

😄 I love developing machine learning open-source projects. I’m looking forward to collaborate on any fun projects.
